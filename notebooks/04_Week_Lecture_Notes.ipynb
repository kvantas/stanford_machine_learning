    "## Non-linear Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing linear regression with a complex set of data with many features is very unwieldy. Say you wanted to create a hypothesis from three (3) features that included all the quadratic terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}& g(\\theta_0 + \\theta_1x_1^2 + \\theta_2x_1x_2 + \\theta_3x_1x_3 \\newline& + \\theta_4x_2^2 + \\theta_5x_2x_3 \\newline& + \\theta_6x_3^2 )\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That gives us 6 features. The exact way to calculate how many features for all polynomial terms is the combination function with repetition: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{(n+r-1)!}{r!(n-1)!}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can approximate the growth of the number of new features we get with all quadratic terms with $\\mathcal{O}(n^2/2)$ . And if you wanted to include all cubic terms in your hypothesis, the features would grow asymptotically at $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. These are very steep growths, so as the number of our features increase, the number of quadratic or cubic features increase very rapidly and becomes quickly impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: let our training set be a collection of 50 x 50 pixel black-and-white photographs, and our goal will be to classify which ones are photos of cars. Our feature set size is then n = 2500 if we compare every pair of pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say we need to make a quadratic hypothesis function. With quadratic features, our growth is $\\mathcal{O}(n^2/2)$ So our total features will be about $2500^2/2=3125000$, which is very impractical.\n",

    "## Model Representation I\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine how we will represent a hypothesis function using neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a very simple level, neurons are basically computational units that take input (dendrites) as electrical input (called \"spikes\") that are channeled to outputs (axons).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our model, our dendrites are like the input features $x_1\\cdots x_n$, and the output is the result of our hypothesis function:\n",
    "TODO add equation\n",
    "In this model our x0 input node is sometimes called the \"bias unit.\" It is always equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In neural networks, we use the same logistic function as in classification: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-\\theta^Tx}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In neural networks however we sometimes call it a sigmoid (logistic) activation function. Our \"theta\" parameters are sometimes instead called \"weights\" in the neural networks model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visually, a simplistic representation looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2 \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}\\ \\ \\ \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow h_\\theta(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our input nodes (layer 1) go into another node (layer 2), and are output as the hypothesis function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first layer is called the \"input layer\" and the final layer the \"output layer,\" which gives the final value computed on the hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have intermediate layers of nodes between the input and output layers called the \"hidden layer.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We label these intermediate or \"hidden\" layer nodes $a^2_0, \\cdots, a^2_n$ and call them \"activation units.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* $a_i^{(j)}$ = \"activation\" of unit $i$ in layer $j$} \n",
    "* $\\Theta^{(j)}$ = matrix of weights controlling function mapping from layer $j$ to layer $j+1$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had one hidden layer, it would look visually something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\newline x_1 \\newline x_2 \\newline x_3\\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow\\begin{bmatrix}a_1^{(2)} \\newline a_2^{(2)} \\newline a_3^{(2)} \\newline \\end{bmatrix}\\rightarrow h_\\theta(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The values for each of the \"activation\" nodes is obtained as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "a_1^{(2)} = g(\\Theta_{10}^{(1)}x_0 + \\Theta_{11}^{(1)}x_1 + \\Theta_{12}^{(1)}x_2 + \\Theta_{13}^{(1)}x_3) \\newline\n",

    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is saying that we compute our activation nodes by using a 3Ã—4 matrix of parameters. We apply each row of the parameters to our inputs to obtain the value for one activation node. Our hypothesis output is the logistic function applied to the sum of the values of our activation nodes, which have been multiplied by yet another parameter matrix $\\Theta^{(2)}$ containing the weights for our second layer of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer gets its own matrix of weights, $\\Theta^{(j)}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensions of these matrices of weights is determined as follows:\n",

    "If network has $s_j$ units in layer $j$ and $s_{j+1}$ units in layer $j+1$, then $\\Theta^{(j)}$ will be of dimension $s_{j+1} \\times s_{j+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The +1 comes from the addition in $\\Theta^{(j)}$ of the \"bias nodes,\" $x_0$ and $\\Theta^{(j)}_0$. In other words the output nodes will not include the bias nodes while the inputs will."
